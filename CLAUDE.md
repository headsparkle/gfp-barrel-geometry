# GFP Beta-Barrel Geometry Project — Claude Instructions

## What this project is
A systematic computational analysis of fluorescent protein (FP) beta-barrel cross-sectional
geometry across 908 crystal structures from the RCSB PDB. The paper is being submitted to
the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling (JCIM).

**Key finding:** Red-shifted FPs have narrower, more elliptical barrels. After re-curating
quantum yield from FPbase (see below), chromophore dihedral twist (|τ|+|φ|: ρ = −0.374) is
the strongest predictor of quantum yield, with the B-factor ratio a secondary correlate
(ρ = −0.309). All QY statistics use the 780-structure canonical cohort. AlphaFold correctly reproduces barrel shape but slightly underestimates
cross-sectional dimensions (~0.5–0.9 Å per axis) due to absence of the mature chromophore.

> **QY re-curation (June 2026):** The original `lit_qy` was corrupted by FPbase keyword
> inheritance — 82% of structures (all 256 greens) were pinned at the wild-type avGFP value
> 0.79. `scripts/recurate_qy_fpbase.py` re-curated QY by PDB-id and chain-A sequence (≥99%)
> matching to FPbase: 354 structures, 0.0001–0.97 (mapping in `data/qy_recuration_fpbase.csv`).
> This overturned the old "B-factor ratio is the strongest QY predictor (ρ = −0.443)" claim.
> Old values preserved as `lit_qy_uncurated`.

## How the pipeline works
1. **Barrel axis:** PCA of backbone Cα coordinates → PC1 = barrel axis
2. **Rotation:** Rodrigues rotation matrix aligns barrel axis to Z
3. **Slice:** All non-H atoms within ±2.0 Å of the chromophore z-coordinate
4. **Geometry:** Convex hull (area, perimeter) + 2D covariance eigenvalues
   - `major = 4 × √(eigenvalue_max)`, `minor = 4 × √(eigenvalue_min)`
   - This is the **correct formula** — earlier scripts had a bug using hull vertices only
5. **Chromophore level:** Mean z of all chromophore heavy atoms; for AlphaFold, z = 0

> **Important:** The axes use `4 × √(eigenvalue)` of the covariance of **all slice atoms**,
> NOT the hull vertices. An earlier version of alphafold_wt_comparison.py used hull vertices
> with factor 2 — that was a ~10 Å bug that has been fixed.

## AlphaFold comparison (n=51 paired)
- 51 proteins from the FPbase FASTA have both an AlphaFold model and a crystal structure
- Matching done via UniProt REST API (https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/{ID}.json)
- Best-resolution crystal structure selected per protein
- Results: AF faithfully captures shape (eccentricity p=0.21 ns, circularity p=0.66 ns)
  but predicts narrower axes (minor: −0.53 Å p=0.002; major: −0.89 Å p=0.002)
  and longer barrels (+3.7 Å p<0.001) vs crystal structures

## Manuscript
The manuscript is built by running:
```bash
python3 scripts/build_jcim_manuscript.py
```
Output: `GFP_JCIM_Manuscript.docx` in the same directory (or `~/Downloads/` if run from there).

The script hard-codes some paths to `~/Downloads/deep_analysis/pub_figures/` for figures.
If running on a new machine, either update those paths or symlink `~/Downloads/deep_analysis/`
to this repo's `data/` and `figures/` directories.

## What still needs to be done (as of May 2026)
1. **GitHub repo** — create one and push this directory
2. **Figure for AlphaFold paired comparison** — a paired scatter or Bland-Altman plot
   for the 51-protein AF vs crystal comparison (no figure exists yet)
3. **Table S4** — raw vs BH-corrected p-values for all 47 hypothesis tests
   (referenced in manuscript but CSV not yet generated)
4. **Update manuscript paths** — `build_jcim_manuscript.py` still references
   `~/Downloads/deep_analysis/` for figure files; should be made relative
5. **Update memory files** — `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/project_gfp_barrel.md`
   still says "877 structures" in some places
